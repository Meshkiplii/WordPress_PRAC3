Coffee Shop Article Website Using Joomla CMS
Project Overview
This week, I transitioned from my first practical assignment to explore the Joomla CMS for building a startup business website. \
Joomla is an open-source content management system that enables easy creation and management of websites. 
The goal of this task was to create a functional, customizable website for my startup, incorporating essential pages, text, and images to reflect the business identity.  

## **Initial Setup**

    Hosting: For this task, I used WordPress’s official hosting with a pre-installed version of WordPress to save time.
    Basic Setup: Similar to Joomla, I set up the site name, admin details, and basic settings during the initial installation.

## **Steps Taken**

    Homepage: Using WordPress’s drag-and-drop editor, I recreated the coffee shop’s homepage with a clean and visually appealing design, ensuring consistency with the previous Joomla version.
    About Us and Contact Us Pages: I reused content from my Joomla site but found WordPress’s interface even more intuitive, which made page creation faster.
    Images and Customization: WordPress’s media library made managing images easy, and I experimented with various themes to get the site to match my startup's brand identity.

## **Challenges Faced**

    Theme Selection: WordPress has a vast selection of themes, but choosing one that closely matched my vision was time-consuming.
    Plugins: WordPress’s ecosystem includes numerous plugins, and identifying which plugins were necessary for enhancing the site without overcomplicating it was a challenge.
    Customization Limits: While WordPress is beginner-friendly, its theme-based approach can sometimes limit deep customization unless one is familiar with PHP or wants to use child themes.

## **Lessons Learned**

    Ease of Use: WordPress is highly intuitive and offers a seamless website-building experience, even for those with little technical expertise.
    Customization Through Plugins: The wide variety of plugins can significantly extend a website's functionality, making WordPress extremely versatile.
    Responsive Design: WordPress themes tend to be more mobile-friendly by default, which reduced the time I spent tweaking responsiveness.

## **Next Steps**

    Enhance Features: I plan to add a booking system for customers to reserve tables or order online in the future.
    Explore Themes: I’ll continue exploring more WordPress themes or customizations to create a unique look.
    Local Development Setup: Like Joomla, I intend to set up a local WordPress development environment for future experiments.

## **Conclusion**

Switching from Joomla to WordPress has been an insightful process. While Joomla offers more control for advanced users, WordPress’s intuitive interface makes it an excellent option for rapid website development. The coffee shop site is coming along well, and I’m eager to explore additional features and customization options moving forward.
