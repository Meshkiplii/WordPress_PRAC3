# Learning Journal Entry
Week 2.
Coffee Shop Article Website Using Joomla CMS Project Overview This week, I transitioned from my first practical assignment to explore the Joomla CMS for building a startup business website.
Joomla is an open-source content management system that enables easy creation and management of websites. The goal of this task was to create a functional, customizable website for my startup, incorporating essential pages, text, and images to reflect the business identity.

Initial Thoughts
Moving to Joomla from working with React and TypeScript felt like a major shift, as Joomla provides a more structured and user-friendly interface for site building, especially for users who are less comfortable with code. My goal was to make sure the website looked unique and fit the needs of a startup, rather than resembling a default Joomla installation. I was particularly interested in understanding how Joomla's template system worked and how I could customize it to align with the branding of the startup.

Steps Taken

Resources I used when Getting Started with Joomla CMS: - Joomla Documentation - Beginner's Guide to Joomla - Installation and Setup:

Hosting Environment: Chose a hosting provider with a 1-click Joomla installer to set up the site. This allowed me to get started without needing to manually install Joomla or configure a local environment. Basic Setup: Completed the initial setup steps, including configuring the site name, admin details, and base settings. Design and Customization:

Homepage: Built the homepage with a clean layout featuring an introduction to the startup, services offered, and contact details. About Us: Developed a simple About Us page, providing a brief overview of the business and its vision. Contact Us: Created a Contact Us page, embedding a contact form and adding the business’s email and physical address. Images and Text: Ensured that all pages featured relevant images and text specific to the business, making the site feel professional and authentic. Navigation:

Challenges Faced
Template Customization: Understanding the intricacies of Joomla's template system took some time, especially when it came to finding the right balance between prebuilt features and custom modifications. Customizing the layout while ensuring mobile responsiveness was also a challenge. Content Management: Since Joomla relies heavily on its content management capabilities, I had to learn how to properly organize and manage articles, categories, and modules to ensure smooth content flow across the site.

Lessons Learned
Joomla CMS offers a robust platform for building dynamic websites, especially for users who may not have coding expertise but need flexibility in design and content management. Customizing a prebuilt Joomla template requires careful consideration of branding elements to avoid a generic look. Understanding how modules and articles work within Joomla's content system is key to creating an organized website. Managing the structure and layout of pages in Joomla relies on understanding how the template manager interacts with content and modules. Next Steps Feature Expansion: I plan to enhance the website by adding features such as a blog section to showcase startup projects. Refinement of Design: Continue fine-tuning the site's visual appeal by experimenting with other Joomla templates or building custom ones to achieve a more unique look. Local Development Environment: As recommended, I plan to set up a local Joomla development environment to facilitate easier testing and development of the website. Conclusion Working with Joomla CMS has been a significant learning experience in content management systems, and I am eager to explore more advanced features in the coming weeks. The ability to quickly build and customize a site without relying heavily on code is a major advantage of Joomla, and I look forward to further refining this project.
