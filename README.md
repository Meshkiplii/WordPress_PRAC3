**WordPress Site for Coffee Restaurant**

This week, the focus shifted from Joomla to WordPress to build a simple website for the startup coffee shop. The main goal was to learn WordPress, reusing much of the content and design from the Joomla site to save time.

## **Learning Activities & Resources**

- **Hosting Setup:** Used WordPress's official hosting with a pre-installed version of WordPress for convenience.
- **Basic Configuration:** Set up the site name, admin details, and initial settings similarly to how it was done in Joomla.

## **Steps Taken**

- **Homepage Design:** Recreated the coffee shop's homepage using WordPress’s drag-and-drop editor, aiming for a clean and visually appealing design consistent with the Joomla version.
- **About Us and Contact Us Pages:** Reused the content from the Joomla site but found WordPress’s interface more intuitive, speeding up the page creation process.
- **Images and Customization:** Leveraged the WordPress media library for easy image management and experimented with different themes to align with the coffee shop’s brand identity.

## **Challenges Faced**

- **Theme Selection:** The vast selection of WordPress themes made finding one that matched the vision time-consuming.
- **Plugins:** Navigating the extensive plugin ecosystem to choose essential plugins without overcomplicating the site was challenging.
- **Customization Limits:** WordPress's theme-based approach sometimes restricted deeper customization unless one is familiar with PHP or uses child themes.

## **Lessons Learned**

- **Ease of Use:** WordPress offers a highly intuitive website-building experience, suitable even for beginners.
- **Versatility Through Plugins:** The wide variety of plugins allows for significant functional enhancements, making WordPress adaptable to different needs.
- **Responsive Design:** Many WordPress themes are mobile-friendly by default, which minimized the time needed for responsiveness adjustments.

## **Next Steps**

- **Feature Enhancements:** Plan to add a booking system for table reservations or online orders.
- **Theme Exploration:** Continue exploring more themes or custom customization options for a unique look.
- **Local Development:** Set up a local WordPress development environment for future testing and experiments, similar to the Joomla setup.

## **Conclusion**

Switching from Joomla to WordPress has been a valuable experience. While Joomla may offer more control for advanced users, WordPress's user-friendly interface makes it ideal for rapid website development. The coffee shop site is progressing well, and I look forward to exploring additional features and customization options.
